The Symbrosia Controller is an innovative open-source hardware and software platform designed to automate and optimize controlled agriculture and aquaculture operations. Initially developed to support on-shore seaweed farming operations in Kailua Kona, Hawai'i, the Symbrosia Controller features a customized, low-cost sensor suite and integrated control functions tailored to meet the unique demands of these environments.
Our core hypothesis is that by automating repetitive tasks in agriculture, we can significantly enhance yields while ensuring sustainable wages within the agricultural sector. Automation reduces the total labor hours required while enabling higher average wages for agricultural workers. For instance, reducing 200 hours of labor at $15/hour to 100 hours with automation allows for a wage increase to $30/hour, maintaining overall labor costs while improving worker compensation.
To validate and expand upon this hypothesis, we have made the Symbrosia Controller open source. This means that the product's source code, design documents, and content are freely accessible and modifiable by anyone. By doing so, we aim to democratize access to cutting-edge agricultural technology, fostering low-cost, efficient, and community-driven food production systems both in Hawai'i and globally.
Furthermore, we envision the Symbrosia Controller as a powerful educational tool. By promoting literacy in electronics, programming, and agricultural management, we hope to empower individuals and communities to innovate and thrive in the agricultural sector. Our goal is to create a robust, collaborative ecosystem where knowledge and technology are shared to drive sustainable agricultural practices and food security worldwide.
