# CO<sub>2</sub> Monitor

As CO<sub>2</sub> is stored as a liquid under pressure in the cylinderor tank, the pressure in the tank is not determined by the amount of gas remaining, but rather by the boiling point of CO<sub>2</sub>.  As a result the working pressure of the tank will remain at 50 to 70 Bar (700-1000 PSI), depending on ambient temperture, until the last liquid boils off.  Only once the liquid is gone will the pressure begin to drop as the last gas from the tank is used.  Setting an alarm threshhold of around 35 Bar (500 PSI) will allow a bit of warning before the available supply of gas is totally expended.
