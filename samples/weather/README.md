# SymbCtrl Weather Station

The weather station is configured to support the sesnors that provide the most useful values to an outdoor aquaculture.

* An air temperature sensor
* A solar heating sensor
* PAR sensor
* Rain gauge

## Sensors

### Air Temperature Sensor
A Pt100 temperature sensor is housed in a small solar radiation shield, thus providing a good reading of local ambient ir temperature.

### Solar Heating Sensor
A Pt100 temperature sensor is positioned to directly measure the solar heating of a surface.  This measurement can provide a relative 

### PAR Sensor
A commercial PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) sensor is connected to one of the general purpose analog inputs.  This provides a calibrated measurement of the avalable solar radiation avalable for algae growth.

### Rain Gauge
A standard tipping bucket rain gauge is connected to one of the digital inputs.

Using the software counter provides a direct measurement of rainfall on your facility.  Configuring the counter with a daily reset then gives a daily precipitation count that can bea easily logged.
